# Puzzle Game Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The puzzle game is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture with custom state management using Context API. The application emphasizes performance, security, and user experience.

### Core Components

1. **State Management**
   - Custom implementation using React Context API
   - Separate contexts for game state, leaderboard, and performance monitoring
   - Optimized re-renders using React.memo and useMemo

2. **Storage Strategy**
   - Encrypted local/session storage
   - Quota management with automatic cleanup
   - Cross-tab synchronization using BroadcastChannel

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Real-time performance monitoring
   - Memory usage tracking
   - FPS optimization
   - Lazy loading of components

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Render Optimization**
   - Component memoization
   - Virtual list for leaderboard
   - Debounced event handlers

2. **Memory Management**
   - Automatic cleanup of old scores
   - Image preloading and caching
   - Efficient DOM updates

3. **State Updates**
   - Batched state updates
   - Selective re-rendering
   - Context splitting

## Security Measures

1. **Data Encryption**
   - Custom encryption for stored data
   - Session management
   - Password hashing

2. **Storage Security**
   - Quota management
   - Data validation
   - Secure storage practices

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Critical functionality testing
   - Edge case coverage
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Component interaction testing
   - State management validation
   - Storage mechanism verification

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Safari: Limited support for performance API
   - IE: Not supported

2. **Performance**
   - Large grid sizes (>10x10) may impact performance
   - Memory usage optimization needed for mobile devices

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - WebWorker implementation for heavy computations
   - PWA support
   - Offline functionality
